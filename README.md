# CalTracker

CalTracker is a Python-based application that helps users track their **daily food intake** and monitor **calorie consumption**.  
By entering food items and portion sizes, the app retrieves calorie information using the **Edamam API** and stores data in a **SQLite Cloud database**.  

The project was developed as part of the **Software Architecture (SFWRTECH 4SA3)** course, following the **4+1 View Model** and applying key design patterns.
